INTRODUCING BIM - for Moodle 2.5
=======================

A Moodle (2.5) Activity module that manages the process of students maintaining an individual learning journal using their choice of blog (or other RSS/ATOM generating service).

*2.5 Specific changes*

Initial move to using nested tabs for the coordinator/marker interface.  Pre-cursor to more work later.

Also modified interface to talk about "prompts", rather than "questions". i.e. students have to respond to prompts for blogging, not questions.

*More information*

Any known issues (including future functionality plans) are recorded on github here

Feel free to add issues that you find. Or even just ask questions.

*What is BIM*

BIM is an activity module for Moodle.  It provides support for teaching
staff to manage, mark and comment (in a private way) on individual 
student blogs that are hosted on external blog engines.  

It has been typically used to manage students maintaining their own reflective/learning journal.
