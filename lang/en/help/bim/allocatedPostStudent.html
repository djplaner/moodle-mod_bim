<h3>What is "allocated"</h3>

<p>When BIM finds a new post to your blog, it tries to see if it matches one of the questions created by the teachers of your course.</p>
<p>When it finds a match, it allocates your post to that question.</p>

<h4>What next</h4>

<p>Initially the newly allocated post will be "not marked". It is waiting for one of the teachers to mark the post. </p>
<p>Once a post is marked, you will not be able to see any marks or comments on your post from the teachers, until your post is released. This delay is so that the marks/comments can be checked and compared with others.</p>
