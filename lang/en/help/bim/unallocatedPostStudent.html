<h2>What is "not allocated"?</h2>

<p>Normally, a BIM activity requires you to post to your blog answers to a set of questions designed by the course teachers.</p>
<p>When BIM sees a new post on your blog, it tries to allocate it to one of the questions.</p>
<p>"Not allocated" means that BIM saw your post and made a copy of it (mirrored it) locally. However, it could not match your post with one of the questions.</p>

<h4>How to change it</h4>

<p>Eventually, one of the teachers will manually allocate your post to a question, though this may take a little while.</p>
<p>To make sure BIM automatically allocates your posts, make sure you use the title of the question in the title or body of your blog post.  For example, if you are answering a question with the title "Week 12 - Reflection", make sure that "Week 12 - Reflection" is part of (or all of) the title of your post.</p>
