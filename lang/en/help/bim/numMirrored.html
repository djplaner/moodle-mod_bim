<h3>What does "# posts mirrored" mean?</h3>

<p>BIM tries to keep a copy of every post you have ever made on your registered blog/feed.  This is a process called mirroring (see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_%28computing%29">Wikipedia page on mirroring</a> for more details on mirroring).</p>
<p>"# posts mirrored" is the number of posts from your blog/feed that BIM has copied locally.</p>
