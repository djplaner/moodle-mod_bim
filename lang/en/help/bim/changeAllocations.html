<h3>Changing post allocations</h3>

<p>Most BIM activities will have a specified list of questions, which students are expected to respond to by posting to their blog.</p>
<p>Before you can mark a student post, that post needs to be allocated to the question.</p>
<p>BIM attempts to automatically allocate student posts to specified questions by matching the content of the question title and the post title. But sometimes this does not work.</p>
<p>This page allows you to manually allocate posts that BIM has failed to automatically allocate.</p>
<p>It shows some details about the student and their blog and then a list of all the questions.</p>

<h4>List of posts</h4>

<p>All of the posts made by the student, that are known by BIM, are shown on this page.</p>
<p>For each post you should see a box that has the:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Status:</strong>; and
   <p>A post can be: Unallocated, Submitted (Allocate, but not marked), Marked, Released and Suspended. </p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Title:</strong>.<p>This is the title of the student post.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Within each box there will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Posted:</strong>;
      <p> the time and date the student made the post public on their blog.</p> </li>
  <li> <strong>Change allocation to:</strong>
      <p>This is the drop box you can use to change the allocation of the post. The drop box contains the titles of all the questions for which the student does not have a post. It also contains the option <strong>Unallocated</strong> which (not unsurprisingly) unallocates the post from a question.</p>
      <p>Whenever you select from this drop box, the form will automatically submit.  Which means you can only change the allocation of one post at a time.</p>
  </li>
  <li> A big green box.<p>The box should contain the full text of the student post.</p></li>
</ul>
