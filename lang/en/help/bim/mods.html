<h3>What is BIM</h3>

<p>BIM stands for BAM into Moodle. BAM stands for Blog Aggregation Management. BAM was the first iteration of BIM.</p>
<p>BIM is a Moodle module that supports an activity where:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Each student registers an individual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed">external web feed</a>.
      <p>The feed might be generated by a blog, twitter or any other tool that produces a web feed. It's the student's choice what they use.</p>
  </li>
  <li> Each student uses that external feed to respond to a set of questions. 
    <p>Currently, those questions usually encourage the student in reflecting on their learning, often in the form of a reflective journal.</p>
     <p>There is no need to have a set of questions.</p>
  </li>
  <li> BIM mantains a copy of each students web feed, and attempts to allocate student posts to the questions. </li>
  <li> BIM allows different teachers to track, manage and mark posts for different groups of students.</li>
  <li> Allows a coordinating teacher to allocate teaching staff to different groups, track their marking progress and all student activity.</li>
  <li> Student results can be sent to the Moodle gradebook. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Origins of BIM</h3>

<p>BIM - starting life as BAM at <a href="http://www.cqu.edu.au/">CQUniversity</a> - arose because of a problem in a course. The course was offered 3 times a year; usually with 100+ students each offering; taught by 10+ staff; distributed across multiple campuses and distance education; and had issues with large failure rates, significant levels of plagiarism, limited quality and quantity of feedback to student progress, and little or knowledge of how students were going.</p>
<p>One assignment in the course required students to maintain a reflective journal of their learning experience. The assignment was worth 10% of the final mark and students were given a series of questions to guide their reflection. The assignment was submitted at the end of term as a Word document.</p>
<p>Students treated the assignment as a creative writing exercise to be commenced just before the submission date. There were problems with plagiarism and staff could not give feedback to students.</p>
<p>To attempt to solve these problems it was decided to move the student reflective journals from a Word document to a personal web blog. The aim was that the students could be visibly seen contributing to (or not) their reflective journal during the term. The teaching staff could look at these contributions and give feedback. The hope was to increase ownership and visibility of the task. To increase student engagement.</p>
<p>With that many students and staff. A tool was needed to manage the process. That tool was BAM. BIM is a translation of BAM into Moodle with some extensions to the tool.</p>
<p>By late 2009, use of BAM at CQUniversity included:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 26 offerings of 7 different courses. </li>
  <li> 2050+ students. </li>
  <li> 16,000+ blog posts. </li>
</ul>

<h3>What's missing in BIM?</h3>

<p>The following is a brief list of features which we think are missing from BIM.</p>
<ul>
  <li> A range of standard Moodle functionality that will be added as time permits.<br />This includes:
       <ul>
         <li> Backup and restore. </li>
         <li> Using student groups to restrict who can use BIM. </li>
         <li> And many others I don't know about (The creation of BIM was in part an exercise in learning Moodle development, it's an on-going lesson).</li>
       </ul>
  <li> Generation of OPML files for teachers.
       <p>Available in BAM, this allows teachers to follow student blog posts from a news reader.</p>
  </li>
  <li> Remix and feed forward.
      <p>Essentially a more advanced version of OPML files for teachers. Remix and feed forward means the ability to manipulate and modify student posts and then make them available for other people.  For example, generating a "best posts" feed that allows people (students, teachers or anyone) view them.</p>
  </li>
  <li> Time release on quesitons.
       <p>The ability to specify a time range within which posts for a particular question must be made.</p>
  </li>
  <li> Copy detection integration.
       <p>Provision of some form of copy detection to look for potential cases of plagiarism. </p>
  </li>
  <li>...and many, many more...</li>
</ul>

<h3>Thanks</h3>

<p>While much of the initial design and coding for BIM was down to one person, that work was only possible due to range of different folk, some of whom I mention below.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Jo Luck for encouragement and helping get the funding the enabled the initial development of BAM. </li>
  <li> The poor staff and students in the T2, 2006 offering COIS20025 who had to struggle with a very "in-development" version of BAM. </li>
  <li> Mary, Derek and the rest of the Webfuse team, because there can never be enough thanks. </li>
  <li> The wonderful folk behind recent restructures who freed me from the burden of command and gave me the time to produce BIM. </li>
  <li> Marilyn for being ornery enough to stick with and expand the idea in the face of some opposition.</li>
</ul>
