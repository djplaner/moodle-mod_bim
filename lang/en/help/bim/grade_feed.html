<p>If this option is selected then a new field will appear in the gradebook for this course.  The name of the field will match the name of this BIM activity.</p>
<p>When you release students' marked posts the mark will appear in that field in the gradebook. The final result for each student in the gradebook will be the total of all the student's released posts added together.</p>
