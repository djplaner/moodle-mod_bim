<p align="center"><strong>Change feeds</strong></p>

<p>For various reasons (e.g. they've forgotten their password, not happy with the name for their blog etc.)  students may wish to change the feed they have already registered.</p>
<p>Selecting this option, allows them to change their registered feeds.</p>
<p>Students have to be aware that if they change their feed, then any content from the old registered feed is lost. BIM only maintains a copy of the currently registered feed. Essentially, students have to remember to post all the content already on their old feed, into the new one.  Typically not a big problem as students usually change their blogs before posting too much content.</p>
