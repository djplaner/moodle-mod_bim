<ul>
  <li> <strong>No answer</strong>; or
     <p>This means that either the student has not answerd this question or that the post in which they did answer the question has not been automatically allocated to the question.  If automatic allocation fails, then you have to use the manual allocation service provided in the <em>Questions</em> column described above.</p>
