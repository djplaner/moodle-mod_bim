<h3>Manage marking</h3>

<p>This page provides the coordinating teacher the ability to :</p>
<ul>
  <li> get an overview of and drill down into the detail of the marking by all teachers in a BIM activity; and</li>
  <li> release marked assignments.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>The overview of marking detail is provided by a table (e.g. <a href="mod/bim/lang/en_utf8/help/bim/pix/manageMarkingTable.png">view image of example table</a>) that has a single row for every marker. For each marker the table will show:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Marker</strong>;
       <p>The marker's name and a link to send them an email.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Studs</strong>;
       <p>The number of students the marker has to mark. </p>
  </li>
  <li> A column for each question for this BIM activity. </li>
</ul>
<p>Each question column for a marker will contain information about their marking progress for that question.  This will take the form of 5 numbers, one number for each of the possible status settings (Submitted, Marked, Suspended, Released, Missing) for a post. </p>

<h4>Drilling down</h4>

<p>The <a href="mod/bim/lang/en_utf8/help/bim/pix/manageMarkingTable.png">example image</a> may be helpful in understanding the following. From that image you may be able to see that the marker "Admin User" has 9 students who are "Missing" the post for the question "The Indicators Project". If you wish to drill down and find out more about these students (e.g. who are they), you click on the link that is "Missing".</p>

<h4>Release marked posts</h4>

<p>In <a href="mod/bim/lang/en_utf8/help/bim/pix/manageMarkingTable.png">the example image</a> you may be able to pick out a number of links for "releasing" student posts.  When you click on any of these links it will change the status of any Marked posts matching different criteria to released.</p>
<p>There are four different ways to release marked posts:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Release all marked posts;
<p>In the <a href="mod/bim/lang/en_utf8/help/bim/pix/manageMarkingTable.png">example image</a> you may be able to see a link <strong>Release all 3 marked post(s)</strong>. Clicking on this link will release all of the marked posts (only 3 in this example). </p>
  </li>
  <li> Release all marked posts for a given question;
<p>In the <a href="mod/bim/lang/en_utf8/help/bim/pix/manageMarkingTable.png">example iamge</a> you may be able to see the links <strong>release</strong> under the question titles <strong>The indicators project</strong> and <strong>Moodle</strong>. Clicking on these links will release all marked posts for that question.</p>
  </li>
  <li> Release all marked posts for a given marker;
<p>In the <a href="mod/bim/lang/en_utf8/help/bim/pix/manageMarkingTable.png">example image</a> you may be able to see the links <strong>release</strong> under the markers' names <strong>Marilyn Wells</strong>, <strong>David Hamilton</strong> and <strong>Kevin Bell</strong>. Clicking on these links will release all posts marked by the particular marker.</p>
  </li>
  <li> Release all marked posts for a question and a marker;
<p>In the <a href="mod/bim/lang/en_utf8/help/bim/pix/manageMarkingTable.png">example image</a> you may be able to see <strong>release</strong> links in a number of cells for specific markers/questions.  For example, in the cell for <strong>The Indicators Project</strong> and <strong>Marilyn Wells</strong>. Clicking on these links will return only those posts marked by that marker for that question.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Only those posts in the Marked state are returned.</p>
