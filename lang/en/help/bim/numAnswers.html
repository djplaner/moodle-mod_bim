<h3>What are "actual" and "required" answers</h3>

<p>Normally (but not always) this type of activity requires you to answer or respond to a number of questions.</p>
<p>"Required answers" is the total number of answers you have to provide. That is, it is the number of questions for this activity.</p>
<p>"Actual answers" is the number of your posts that have been allocated to a question. That is they have been recognised as an answer for a question.</p>

<h4>But I've answered more questions, what now?</h4>

<p>It may be the case that you have posted more answers on your blog than BIM has recognised.  For example, you've posted 5 answers on your blog but "Actual answers" is saying you've done only 3.</p>
<p>There are a few possible explanations:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Not all your answers have been allocated to questions yet.<br />Can you see the title of all of your answers/posts in the "All posts" table?  Does the "Status" column in that table show "Not allocated to a question" for some of your posts?  <p>This means that BIM knows about your posts, but has not been able to allocate them to a question. Your teacher will need to manually allocate your post to a question.</p></li>
  <li> You have only just made a new post.<br />BIM only attempts to copy your posts once every hour or so.  If you have made a new post in the last hour or so it will probably not show up here yet.  You need to wait a little while.</li>
  <li> There's been some problem with copying.<br />If it's been a couple of days since you made your post and it still doesn't show up in the "All posts" table. Then there is a problem with copying.<p>Are you sure that you have made your post public (it's not saved in a draft form)?</p><p>Are you able to visit your blog?</p></li>
</ul>
