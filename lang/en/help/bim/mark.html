<h3>Mark</h3>

<p>Each student post allocated to a question can be awarded a mark.</p>
<p>Usually this mark should be no less than a minimum mark and no greater than a maximum mark allocated by the teacher in charge to this question.</p>
<p>The form shows the minimum and maximum mark for the question on the Marking page as min and max.</p>

<h4>You can break the range</h4>

<p>BIM will not stop you from awarding a mark outside of the range specified by min and max.  It will warn you, but still store the mark you have awarded.</p>
