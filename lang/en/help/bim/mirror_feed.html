<p align="center"><strong>Mirror</strong></p>

<p>BIM creates a mirror of the feed for each student blog or resource. A mirror is a local up-to-date copy of the feed.</p>
<p>While this option is selected the feeds registered for this course will be mirrored. De-select and the mirror process will cease.</p>
<p>Typically the mirror process is only left on while the course is being offered.</p>
<p>The mirror process is run once when the student first registers their feed. It is then run every hour on all student feeds to see if any changes have occured.</p>
