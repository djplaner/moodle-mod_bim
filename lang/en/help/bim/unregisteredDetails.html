<h3>Unregistered student</h3>

<p>The first step students must complete when using a BIM activity is to create and register their blog or feed.</p>
<p>Unregistered students have not yet completed this task.</p>

<h4>Details</h4>

<p>The table will show the students' username and name as it appears in Moodle. It also provides you with two actions you can perform for each student:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Send email;<p>Usually used to send the student a private email asking them to register their blog, or explain their difficulties.</p>
  </li>
  <li> Register blog.<p>This allows you to register the student's blog for them, if they have been having difficulties.  You will need to know the URL for their blog or feed before registering it.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Email addresses</h4>

<p>There is also a textbox that contains all of the email addresses for the unregistered students separated by a semi-colon (;).</p>
<p>You can copy and paste these addresses into an email client and send the students' an email message encouraging or explaining how to register.</p>
<p>You may need to change the semi-colon's to commas to get them to work with your email client.</p>
