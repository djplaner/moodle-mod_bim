Using this as a temp holding place for tasks I need to revisit
during the bim2 conversion process

lib.php
- Get bim_cron working

**** VIEW.PHP
- need to figure out what to do with print_header, and where
  to do it.  Needs to migrate down into the different views

Marker 
- pretty up box
- revisit help icons
- fix up how table for registered students is created

All
--- the INTRO stuff is getting displayed everywhere
- replace print_heading print_box_start with
   echo $OUTPUT->
- change get_records_sql
- Use of implode for generatin IN SQL may need to be changed
- replace implode with DB->get...
- fix up table names in get_records_select

Checks
- internal jumps e.g. Manage Marking for coordinator

Replace
- helpbutton($page, $title, $module, $image, $linktext, $text, $return, $imagetext);
with 
$helpicon = new help_icon();
$helpicon->page = $page; // required
$helpicon->text = $title; // required
$helpicon->module = $module; // defaults to 'moodle'
$helpicon->linktext = $linktext;
 
echo $OUTPUT->help_icon($helpicon);
 *** need to fix this help icons up

***** Work over easter

<h3>Manage questions</h3>

Initially some problems with how I deleted slashes with inserting stuff into the database. But also appears to be similar problems with extracting stuff from the database.

It actually looks like there have been major changes in the handling of the HTML editors in Moodle 2.  A range of extra information needs to be set.

Need to look onlin for more of this.

<h3>Manage questions - improvements</h3>

<ul>
   <li> help buttons for elements to add. <strong>DONE</strong> </li>
   <li> Work on the introductory text. <strong>DONE</strong> </li>
</ul>

<h3>Allocate markers</h3>

It was crashing, ended up being simple typo. Up and going.

<h3>Manage marking</h3>

Displaying the heading, but then crashing. Problem is in bim_get_all_marker_stats.  The in_or_equals needs to be used properly as it hasn't made the leap over...complex data structures

*** have started doing some modifications in lib/locallib.php and in coordinator/manage_marking.php that needs to be completed....

<h3>Find student</h3>

When actually doing the find generates an error in line 101 of find_student.

get_records_select syntax has changed, fixed that up. Had to make some changes to the "where" part of the SQL used here. 

<strong>Note:</strong> wondering if this will make any difference to cross-platform operation

Now the process for showing multiple users isn't working.  Problem with get_records_select..again.  Also problem with table display.

...Now there's a problem with the table being displayed. details_table is showing "register feed" etc even if there is a feed registered... because not passing in feed details.... the header for the table is not correct...


Will also need to test the display when there is 0 or 1 student matched.
