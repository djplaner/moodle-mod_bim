Using this as a temp holding place for tasks I need to revisit
during the bim2 conversion process

lib.php
- Get bim_cron working

**** VIEW.PHP
- need to figure out what to do with print_header, and where
  to do it.  Needs to migrate down into the different views

Marker 
- pretty up box
- revisit help icons
- fix up how table for registered students is created

All
--- the INTRO stuff is getting displayed everywhere
- replace print_heading print_box_start with
   echo $OUTPUT->
- change get_records_sql
- Use of implode for generatin IN SQL may need to be changed
- replace implode with DB->get...
- fix up table names in get_records_select

Checks
- internal jumps e.g. Manage Marking for coordinator

Replace
- helpbutton($page, $title, $module, $image, $linktext, $text, $return, $imagetext);
with 
$helpicon = new help_icon();
$helpicon->page = $page; // required
$helpicon->text = $title; // required
$helpicon->module = $module; // defaults to 'moodle'
$helpicon->linktext = $linktext;
 
echo $OUTPUT->help_icon($helpicon);
 *** need to fix this help icons up
